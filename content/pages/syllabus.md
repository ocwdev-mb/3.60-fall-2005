Lectures: Two sessions / week, 1.5 hours / lecture

Course Overview
---------------

This course covers the derivation of symmetry theory; lattices, point groups, space groups, and their properties; use of symmetry in tensor representation of crystal properties, including anisotropy and representation surfaces; and applications to piezoelectricity and elasticity.

Prerequisites
-------------

The only prerequisites for this course are familiarity with linear algebra and matrix mathematics. Course concepts are developed from first principles using basic geometry.

Textbook
--------

There is no required textbook. Students are expected to read handouts as listed in the {{% resource_link 5c93f2b1-5536-7d91-878e-b2224ece1c30 "readings" %}} section.

Grading
-------

A student's grade is based entirely upon an equal weighting of the three quizzes.
